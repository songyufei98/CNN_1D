## Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM)

### Data Description
- Influencing factors and labels are both in TIF format, and the width and height of the dimensions are the same.
- Influencing factor is named as **xxx_5.tif** (5 is the number of reclassifications, which can be modified to the value of your own data).
- The label naming should include **label** (for easy automatic recognition by the program). See the image below.
- The label needs to be made into a point with four types of 0, 1, 2, and 3, and specifically refers to the project **example_label.tif**.
